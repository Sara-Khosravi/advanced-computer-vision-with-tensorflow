## Image Classification 

* Multi-class Classification
  * Binary Classification (Subset of problem)
* Multi-label Classification

## Recap
 * Multi-class classification

## Binary vs. Multi class classification

## Object Localisation

Identifying where is object in image is calling **Object Localisation**

## Object Detection
Combined Object detection and multi-label classification is calling **Object detection**

## Object Detection

* For each object
  * confidence score
  * bounding boxes
* Popular algorithms
  * R-CNN
  * Faster-RCNN
  * YOLO
  * SSD

## Image segmentation

In digital image processing and computer vision, [image segmentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_segmentation) is the process of partitioning a digital image into multiple image segments, also known as image regions or image objects (sets of pixels).

There are two types of segmentation: 
* **Semantic Segmentation**: All objects are sames types from the single classification.
* **Instance Segmentations**:Instance Segmentation is the technique of detecting, segmenting, and classifying every individual object in an image.
